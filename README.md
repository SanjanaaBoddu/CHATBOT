# CHATBOT
This project involves building a question-answering chatbot using a deep learning approach. The chatbot is trained on a dataset consisting of stories, questions, and answers. The implementation utilizes natural language processing techniques, including tokenization and word embedding, to convert text data into a format suitable for neural network models. The model architecture involves processing input sequences and questions separately, computing their similarity, and generating responses based on the matching results. Regularization techniques such as dropout are applied to prevent overfitting, and the model is trained using the RMSprop optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training history is visualized to monitor the model's performance, and the trained model is evaluated on test data. Finally, the chatbot is tested on new input data to generate predictions with associated probabilities of certainty.
